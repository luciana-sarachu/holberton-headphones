# holberton-headphones

In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

You won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

Here the final result:

*This webpage has been designed by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer.*

## Requirements

- you are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
- you are not to use Javascript

### Tasks

**0. Read and be familiar with Figma**

Create an account in Figma and open this project and “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details.

Important notes with Figma:

- if your computer doesn’t have missing fonts, you can find them here: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT
- some values are in float - feel free to round them
For this task, please write an amazing README.md

***Interactions note:***

- the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
- links hover/active: #FF6565
- button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
- max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page

**1. Header**

Building a web page the right way, is not easy - expect if you put in place strong foundations:

- reset CSS styling
- use variables
- simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
- avoid using super specific CSS selectors as much as possible
- simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!

Last advice: Personally, I always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom. But you can try to other way - it’s fine - but you should structure the way that you will implement a component and not get lost with HTML tags.

Now, your turn!

For this first task: create the header/hero piece

Here an archive of all assets needed: images_0x09.zip

**2. "What we do..." section**

Copy files from the previous task.

For this second task: create the “What we do…” section

In this section, you will need custom font icons. Here the archive of it: holberton_school-icon.zip Inside you will find demo page of how to use it.

Important: try to build as generic as you can… you will probably need some components in next section.

**3. "Our results" section**

Copy files from the previous task.

For this third task: create the “Our results” section

Now you can reuse components form the previous task!

4. Contact us

Copy files from the previous task.

A good landing page has always a contact form.

You are free to add any animations and/or constraints on fields.

**5. Footer**

Copy files from the previous task.

Last piece of the page… the Footer!
